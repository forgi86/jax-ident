# System Identification in Jax

An experimental code base for system identification with Jax. Borrows from [pytorch-ident](https://github.com/forgi86/pytorch-ident) for data loaders and metrics.

Implements training of state-space models as described e.g. in https://github.com/forgi86/sysid-neural-estimator.
